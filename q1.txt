Explain all the CSS positions(static, fixed, sticky, relative, absolute) with one code
 example each.
STATIC:->>>>>>>>
HTML elements are positioned static by default.
Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properti
es.
An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned
 according to the normal flow of the page:
example-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
div.static {
  position: static;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>position: static;</h2>

<p>An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:</p>

<div class="static">
This div element has position: static;
</div>

</body>
</html>
FIXED:->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it
always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom,
and left properties are used to position the element.
A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been
located.
EX:-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
div.fixed {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
  width: 300px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h2>position: fixed</p>
<div class="fixed">
This div element has position: fixed;
</div>

</body>
</html>

STICKY:->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.
A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset 
position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
div.sticky {
  position: -webkit-sticky;
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  padding: 5px;
  background-color: #cae8ca;
  border: 2px solid #4CAF50;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<p>Try to <b>scroll</b> inside this frame to understand how sticky positioning works.</p>

<div class="sticky">I am sticky!</div>

<div style="padding-bottom:2000px">
  <p>In this example, the sticky element sticks to the top of the page (top: 0), when you reach its scroll position.</p>
  <p>Scroll back up to remove the stickyness.</p>
  <p>Some text to enable scrolling.. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, illum definitiones no quo, maluisset concludaturque et eum, altera fabulas ut quo. Atqui causae gloriatur ius te, id agam omnis evertitur eum. Affert laboramus repudiandae nec et. Inciderint efficiantur his ad. Eum no molestiae voluptatibus.</p>

</div>

</body>
</html>
RELATIVE:-->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal
position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

example:-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
div.relative {
  position: relative;
  left: 30px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>position: relative;</h2>

<p>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position:</p>

<div class="relative">
This div element has position: relative;
</div>

</body>
</html>

ABSOLUTE:->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to
the viewport, like fixed).
However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the
document body, and moves along with page scrolling.

example:-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
div.relative {
  position: relative;
  width: 400px;
  height: 200px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
} 

div.absolute {
  position: absolute;
  top: 80px;
  right: 0;
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h2>position: absolute;</h2>
<p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed):</p>
<div class="relative">This div element has position: relative;
  <div class="absolute">This div element has position: absolute;</div>
</div>
</body>
</html>
