3. Explain what is execution context in detail with diagram
ANS-everything in javasript happens inside an execution context.The Execution Context 
contains the code that's currently running, and everything that aids in its execution. 
During the Execution Context run-time, the specific code gets parsed by a parser, the 
variables and functions
are stored in memory, executable byte-code gets generated, and the code gets executed.
In execution context there are two parts.first is code part and second is memory part.
when ever javascript code starts executing than it execute line by line code.in execution context
of code part it form key value pair;like if code is
var a=10;
var b=4;
function sum(){
    var c=a+b;
    return c;
}
var c=sum()
than in code block first form "a=undefine and b=undefine" after that whole function comes 
in code block like "function sum(){}".and "c=Undefine"
in memory block code is executed line by line.than it value is assingining line by line.
"a=10""b:4".
than again in code block a=10 and b=4; and after code goes to line 12 in code block and
it see that is function block of code than nothing is going to run because code reun when 
function is calling.than line 12,13,14,15, nothing hapeen and codes goes to line 16
that is calling function sum.and it is undefine is code block.it again form Execution context in memory
block.again forn two block one is code and other is memory block;than again scan javascript
code and in code part define "c=undefine" and in memory part "c=10+4" comes.and after undefine
becomes c=14.than 13 line goesexecuted.and in main execution box of code block c becomes "c=14"
global execution code is take care by call stack.in call stack it places lowest part.
and sum function come i stack above execution context.it run line by line in function block
and it comes out from call stack.and only left execution context in call stack.
call stack maintains the order of execution contexts.
